# Agents Marketplace

A community-driven collection of custom coding agent configurations for AI assistants. This repository hosts JSON configuration files that define specialized AI coding agents with specific skills and toolsets.

## About This Repository

The Agents Marketplace is designed to be a central hub where developers can find and share configurations for specialized AI coding assistants. Each agent is defined by a JSON configuration file that specifies:

- The agent's name and identity
- Detailed instructions that shape the agent's behavior and expertise
- A set of tools the agent can utilize

## Available Agents

## How to Submit Your Own Agent Configuration

We welcome contributions from the community! Follow these steps to submit your own custom agent configuration:

### Submission Guidelines

1. **Follow the Standard Format**: Your JSON configuration file should follow this structure:

```json
{
  "name": "Your Agent Name",
  "instructions": "Detailed instructions that define your agent's behavior, expertise, and approach...",
  "tools": [
    "Tool 1",
    "Tool 2",
    "Tool 3"
  ]
}
```

2. **Provide Comprehensive Instructions**: The instructions field should include:
   - A clear identity statement (e.g., "You are SecuritySentinel, a security auditing specialist...")
   - A numbered list of steps or approaches the agent should follow
   - Guidance on how the agent should request additional information
   - Specific output format expectations
   - Any other behavioral guidance that shapes the agent's expertise

3. **Name Your File Appropriately**: Use kebab-case for your filename (e.g., `security-auditor.json`, `performance-optimizer.json`)

### Submission Process

1. Fork this repository
2. Add your agent configuration file to your forked repository
3. Ensure your file follows the required format and naming convention
4. Submit a pull request with a brief description of your agent's purpose and capabilities
5. Wait for review by the repository maintainers

### Review Criteria

Submissions will be reviewed based on:

- Adherence to the required format
- Quality and comprehensiveness of the instructions
- Uniqueness and usefulness of the agent concept
- Appropriate tool selection

## Using These Agent Configurations

These configuration files are designed to be used with AI assistant platforms that support custom instructions and tool configurations. The specific implementation details may vary depending on the platform you're using.
