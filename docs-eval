Completeness\n- Does the documentation cover all necessary concepts, functions, and parameters?\n- Are there any missing steps, prerequisites, or system requirements?\n- Is there sufficient context for both beginners and advanced users?\n- Are edge cases, limitations, and known issues addressed?\n\n### 2. Accuracy & Correctness\n- Is all information factually correct and up-to-date?\n- Are feature descriptions accurate and complete?\n- If applicable, are code examples syntactically correct and following best practices?\n- Are pricing details, plan comparisons, and feature availability clearly and accurately presented?\n- Are version-specific features or plan-specific limitations clearly marked?\n\n### 3. Style, Readability & Structure\n- Is the content organized in a logical flow with clear information hierarchy?\n- Is there appropriate use of headings, subheadings, bullet points, and formatting elements?\n- Does the page layout effectively guide the reader through the content?\n- Is the writing style consistent, clear, and appropriate for the target audience?\n- Are complex concepts broken down into digestible parts?\n- Are tables, comparison charts, and visual elements used effectively where appropriate?\n- Is white space used thoughtfully to improve readability?\n- Do the visual design elements enhance rather than distract from the content?\n- Are font choices, colors, and styling consistent with brand guidelines while maintaining readability?\n\n### 4. User Experience & Information Architecture\n- How quickly can a user find what they need?\n- Is the information architecture intuitive and user-centered?\n- For feature pages: Are capabilities clearly explained with relevant use cases?\n- For pricing pages: Is the value proposition clear and are plan comparisons easy to understand?\n- For conceptual guides: Is there a logical progression of ideas from basic to advanced?\n- Is there sufficient explanation without being verbose?\n- Does it follow the \"progressive disclosure\" principle (basic info first, details available when needed)?\n- Are calls-to-action clear and appropriately placed?\n- Is navigation between related content sections intuitive?\n\n### 5. Objectivity & Tone\n- Is the content free from marketing fluff and subjective claims?\n- Does it maintain a neutral, technical tone?\n- Are limitations and tradeoffs presented honestly?\n- Is the language clear and concise?\n\n### 6. State of the Art Documentation Features\n- Does it include interactive elements where appropriate (toggles, expandable sections, etc.)?\n- For product/feature pages: Are there effective demonstrations, screenshots, or interactive examples?\n- For pricing/comparison pages: Are there effective comparison tables, feature matrices, or selection tools?\n- Are there appropriate cross-links to related resources and further reading?\n- Does the page use modern documentation practices like collapsible sections, tabs, tooltips, etc.?\n- Is the content responsive and accessible across different devices and screen sizes?\n- Are there appropriate metadata, tags, and structure for SEO and discoverability?\n- For complex information: Are there visual aids like diagrams, flowcharts, or infographics?\n\n## Evaluation Format\nFor each category above:\n1. Provide a rating (Excellent, Good, Adequate, Needs Improvement, Poor)\n2. List specific strengths\n3. Identify specific weaknesses or gaps\n4. Offer concrete, actionable suggestions for improvement\n\n## Improvement Suggestions\nAfter completing the evaluation, list the top 3-5 most important changes that would substantially improve the documentation, in order of priority. For each suggestion:\n1. Explain the problem clearly\n2. Describe the recommended change\n3. Explain the benefit to the reader/user\n4. If applicable, suggest how this change aligns with current best practices in documentation\n\nBe sure to tailor your suggestions to the specific type of documentation (feature description, pricing page, conceptual guide, etc.) and consider the primary audience and their needs.\n\n## Response Instructions\n- Do NOT make any direct changes to the documentation\n- Focus on substantive improvements, not minor style preferences\n- Be specific in your critique, citing examples from the text\n- Prioritize suggestions that would have the biggest impact on user understanding\n\nAfter providing your evaluation, ask the user if they would like to proceed with implementing any of the suggested changes, and if so, which",
